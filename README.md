# Harvest Moon
I'm not a farmer, but I aspire daily to be one. And so should you. Grab that hoe and get to work.

In order to test out those cultivation skills in a near real-world environment, I've written a pretty simple farming game on python that in no way resembles what you may actual experience while working a field. I'm still learning quite a bit from "learnpythonthehardway.com," but since it's my first project, make sure you rip it apart.

Here's the break-down: 

1. You're given a paltry $10 to buy seeds from a wide variety of crops that everyone adores eating: onions, carrots, corn, wheat, lettuce, and broccoli (the most "ew" one).
2. You may also purchase fertilizer (for fear of being sued by Monsanto, I do not disclose the precise contents that make up the fertilizer), which can increase your field's fertility (this typically dictates your crop yield, with some caveats)
3. You'll also need to sow your seeds during some specified period. Your crop output depends on when you plant your seeds.
4. Middle Eastern farmers practiced crop rotation nearly 6k years ago. We still do it. And so should you. As you go through farming seasons, think about what types of crops you planted in the previous season and how that might affect your current season's crops.
5. I included some random disaster events to keep you on your toes. Some of it could or could not happen in real life. It's a game, so get over it and keep planting.
6. You win if you make $50 and lose if you run out of money. No government to bail you out here.

If you do so find it in you, please provide comments, especially on how to make the code shorter or run more efficiently. Thanks!
